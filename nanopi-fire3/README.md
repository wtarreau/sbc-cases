This is an acrylic enclosure for FriendlyELEC's NanoPI-Fire3. It respects
exact internal dimensions and is made for 3mm-thick acrylic. It features all
holes (including buttons) and also digs into the acrylic around the micro-USB
power connector and the micro-HDMI display output.

There is still room inside the enclosure to place a small battery for the RTC
just above the CPU's heatsink. There would even still be a little bit of room
for a USB serial adapter to access the console.

However it is needed to put a bit of foam inside on the micro-USB connector
side, otherwise the board moves on this side.
