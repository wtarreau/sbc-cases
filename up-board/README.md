This model is for UP board (the original version).

The PCB dimensions are 85x56mm, but some documents indicate 85.6x56.5. The
enclosure supports 87x56.5 so that it is possible to connect a USB-serial board
to CN7 on the front side.

The bottom plate was removed and replaced by a small thermal pad to conduct
some of the heat directly to the bottom acrylic plate.

The fan was left unconnected after having served a few years like this without
trouble. The enclosure allows to keep the fan running, though it would require
to drill some holes in the top and front plates so that cool air is sucked from
the top and exhausted from the front.

A reset button was added and connected to CN14, placed in front of the hole
marked R and fixed with hot glue.

A 2mm-thick piece of acrylic was used and the kerf set to 0.2mm to keep some
margin. An alignment layer is provided to help replace the box artwork if
required (e.g. in order to support a different thinkness).

The internal height is set to 21.5mm in order to leave a little bit of material
above the USB connectors to help fix the top plate.
