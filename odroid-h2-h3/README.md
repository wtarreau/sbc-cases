This model is for HardKernel's ODROID H2/H2+/H3/H3+ boards.

It only proposes a top and a bottom plates tied together using screws and
spacers. The total height is 55mm, which allows to fit two 2,5" SSDs on one
side. There are aeration holes on top of the CPU heat sink and the SSDs.

It is suggested not to install side walls in order to let air flow inside, pass
through the heat sink, and escape through the top plate holes. If a back plate
is desired, the vendor's wiki provides diagrams showing precise dimensions for
the board's holes and connectors.

The board itself is 11x11cm and 47mm tall. The PCB is 2.1mm thick. 35.5mm
spacers are required at between the PCB and the top layer, and 9.5mm spacers
are required between the PCB and the bottom layer. The total height with 3mm
thick acrylic is 55mm.

The complete dimensions once assembled are:
  W = 210 mm
  D = 120 mm
  H = 55 mm

The SVG model is reasonably easy to adapt to other material thicknesses, only
the holes to support the SSD brackets need to be adjusted.

Exact sized spacers were not found for the model on the photo. Instead, shorter
spacers were used and connected using a threaded rod. Another threaded rod was
needed to connect two spacers across the PCB so that it was possible to finish
the whole design using regular screws.
