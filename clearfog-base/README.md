This model is for the SolidRun Clearfog Base board. It was made using 1.75mm
thick cardboard as a proof-of-concept but revealed quite sturdy given that
the heatsink adds some rigidity to the whole thing.

The reset button is not accessible, it requires a hole on the top. The
micro-SD hole is not made either because my board uses eMMC which is
exclusive with the micro-SD.

An alternative design would consist in reducing the thickness (23mm) by the
material's thickness, and placing a hole inside the cover plane so that the
heatsink appears outside.

Due to the employed cardboard pieces, only 3 pieces are made per step, which
explains why there are two distinct output layers.
